Albeit specifying exclude: table; the component is contained in the resulting dist file. 

I also specified card as to be included. It failed to be available on certain occasions as well. In this example it is available in the resulting css.

Running via:

```
deno run -A npm:vite build
```

tested deno version:

```
deno --version
deno 2.2.3 (stable, release, aarch64-apple-darwin)
v8 13.4.114.11-rusty
typescript 5.7.3
```
